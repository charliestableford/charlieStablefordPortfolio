                    The learning curve of developing constructs in coding or programming is steep. There are many platforms that help folks that are in the very beginning stages of learning - often referred to as the ‘hand holding period’. The platforms that are available after this period are stackoverflow and websites like it. They are helpful to get beginner developers ‘unstuck’. Unfortunately stackoverflow often involves a lot of searching for keywords and plugging in code that is not necessarily applicable to the problem. Collaborating with peers is important and helpful but explaining a specific issue can be time consuming.</br></br> Could a platform be created that would allow beginner programmers to problem solve? What if the platform had the ability to learn from the user - becoming smarter and more specific to the user the more it was used.

                I came up with a concept, did user research to make sure the product was viable, created affinity diagrams, did rapid prototyping, paper prototyping, wireframing, tested the product and created high fidelity mockups to test. As a further push for this project I researched how to program Rubber Ducky with voice activation and how to connect it to the Google AI API.

                There are many ways to solve a programming or development problem. There are different standards across languages and always different paths to a similar outcome. The idea of this can leave a beginner programmer frozen, not knowing which way to get out of the most simple circumstances. This stage of programming is known as the ‘desert.’
