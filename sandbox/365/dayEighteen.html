           I am doing a project for a non-profit called 9to5 right now - I am the developer who is assisting on the project. It is hosted through squarespace and one of the things that the client would like is to have a donation button where the user can click on the button and donate an amount and then in the email sent have a link that brings them back to the squarespace site and here they would download the cookbook! They would like the user to only download the cookbook once. So this is a quick one click wonder test!
