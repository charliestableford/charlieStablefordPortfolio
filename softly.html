            Softly was fully coded PHP based content management system that in its first version was intended to be accessible, easy to navigate and beautiful. </br></br> Softly was used for five projects within a four month period. The first three clients that were used Softly were mock clients and were used as a part of a grading structure. <br><br>
            The last two clients were real world clients. <br><br>I redesigned Softly to make it fit the clients and be geared towards their needs as well as do testing to ensure that their experience was as intuitive as possible. <br><br> In the end the functionality needed for their CMS leaned towards hosting their website on Wordpress as opposed to my custom CMS so the final version is a tested design as opposed to a coded CMS.

            Initial Analysis

        <div class="itemLeft content-15 blue box">
        This project originally had a very tight timeline. The focus was on its functionality as opposed to UX / UI focused. To begin the process of redesign I made a list of all of the ways that it could be improved upon. 

        This is how I created my hypothesis for what aspects of Softly should be altered.  
        </div>

        <div class="itemLeft content-17 smTitle blue lgMarg">
            User Journey Flow
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-18 blue box">
        After identifying pain points I went back to cards - to be clear about what I wanted my CMS design to look like, what I wanted the user journey to look like and that the functionality would be met within the criteria I had set for myself. In the first iteration of Softly user journey flows were not brought to conception so the outcome of this practice was very important when thinking about the redesign.  
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-19 smTitle blue lgMarg">
            Key CMS Pages
        </div>
        <div class="item content-20 upper">

        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-21 blue box lgMarg">
        In the redsign of Softly the functionality was streamlined to restrict what the user was capable of. This was done to keep consistency across the front end of the site. The pages that were focused on were -  
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-22 smTitle blue lgMarg">
            Log in screen
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-23 sq">
        <img src="imgs/casestudies/softly/softly1.png" class="sm">
        <img src="imgs/casestudies/softly/login.png" class="med">
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-24 blue box lgMarg">
        The feedback that was recieved from the log in screen was that not all users would know what a content a content management system is used for. 

        The redesign aimed to have a stronger heirarchy of typeography and a clear CTA.   
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-25 smTitle blue lgMarg">
            Dashboard

        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-27 blue box lgMarg">
        A feature of the dashboard that the client wanted to highlight was Google Analytics so I wanted this to be the most 
        prominent aspect of the home page.This would also provide constant positive feedback associated with the website.     
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-28 smTitle blue lgMarg">
            Edit pages

        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-30 blue box lgMarg">
        The functionality of the page management portion of Softly became streamlined to what the client wanted. The hierarchy the page altered to have a clear flow of the edit page.This was to improve the feedback state between user and CMS.

        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-33 blue box lgMarg">
        In this design there is a help / FAQ section as a manual to help the user along with frequent questions. This is something I would hope to update as time went on and I continued to user test to improve the product. These questions are based on frequent questions that came up during testing.    
        </div>

            Outcome
        </div>
        <div class="itemLeft content-35 blue box">
        The goal of redesigning this CMS was for it to be delivered to a client as a fully functional CMS that was powered by Node. As I began to redesign the functionality that was required for this CMS became something that needed to be more dynamic then what I was able to create with my skillset. So the end project was a full redesign that was user tested but not a full product that woule be able to meet a deliverable. 
        <br><br>
        The testing mainly was with folks who had not used a personalized CMS before and were not tech savvy. I wanted anyone to be able to use it and have it be very self explainatory. 
        <br><br>
        In the end I was happy with the designed product and happy with the conclusion to not move forward with Node.
