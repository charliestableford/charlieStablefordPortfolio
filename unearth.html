There is an undeniable climate crisis and people are standing up. With this there is a space in education where folks can learn about their surroundings.
                    <br>
                    <br> Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammals go extinct every 24 hours. It is so many that one cannot keep track or have an idea of what those animals are. In a society that is constantly discussing climate change, emissions and the next steps for reducing CO2 this AR platform aims to educate people of all ages on the animals that used to be on the land and in the seas of where they are standing.

                        <span class="lg">T</span>here is currently an AR app, called Extinct Animals iExplore AR, which allows users to discover animals that would have existed where they are and interacting with the world around them. These animals span our entire history as a human race, and before (including dinosaurs). The purpose of this app is to learn about species but it is not location specific and the curation of animals is loose - the animal models come in different styles and is not consistent making it feel not real. There are also apps that allow users to be immersed in an environment to do activities such as, be underwater and swim with whales, or be on a boat and view geometric whales.
