                <br> There is currently a growing awareness for end-of-life practitioners. There is also a growing number of people in this field. Many of whom cannot reach the audience that they would like to.
                <br/>
                <br/> The objective is to design an end-to-end experience of connecting with a death doula online. This platform connects clients with death doulas across North America allowing them to reach a wider audience and assist more people in the grieving process.

                <br> The platform UI prototype must be fully flushed out and be user driven on both the client side and the doula side.

            The original palette was based on surveys. The question that lead to this was, “What is a calming colour for you.” This palette was too close to Talkspace - which is our main competitor.
            <br>
            <br> The second palette was based on colour psychology. Orange signifies shelter, allowing us to evade an grief or disappointment that may be dominating our minds. The color promotes rejuvenation, positivism, and optimism.

            Pricing came in two iterations. The first iteration was a model that leaned upon similar platforms. This process was having the client pay through the app for the service and With would then take a percentage of this payment.<br><br><br><br>

        <div class="itemLeft content-56 blue pinch">
            The next iteration made the platform free for both Death Doulas and their clients to use. This concept involves funeral homes, Douglas College and the Death Doula Association of Canada. Many Death Doulas do not have enough clients to have to be a fill time profession. If With paired with Douglas College and the Death Doula Association of Canada it would be a way of ensuring work after the program ended.
            <br>
            In the end, for the bounds of this project creating a pay system that takes a portion of the amount that the end of life practioners are charging is the most straight forward, so I ended up going with the first iteration. In the future, if I continued with this project, I would want to make it a free service for the doulas. <br>

        When a death doula takes on clients they take them on in 8 session increments. These sessions are arranged between the doulas and the client and can be services anywhere from a phone call to a meeting in person with their family.<br>
        For 8 sessions doulas charge an average of $800. The goal of this platform is for Death doulas to extend their reach. Doulas have estimated that they would be able to take 10-12 clients per month in addition to their client load in person. If a death doula took on 10 clients they would be able to make a range of $1,800 - $2,400 per month. If I took a 5% cut from each  I would be making $90-$120 per month, per subscription. If there were 100 clients using the platform it would generate $9,000-$12,000 per month. <br>  
        I believe it would take me 6-8 months to develop this product with a team. Within 12 months I would like to be partnered with the death doula association and Douglas College - having them use it for thier memebers and graduates. My goal would be to have 500 users within 4 months. This would be 50+ death doulas using the app.

            The user testing that was one on this product was a learning experience for me, as it is the biggest app that I have built out in this fashion. This meant that the feedback recieved was of a large volum every time that it was tested. After the first round of testing I began to do more conentrated AB testing to get faster feedback on smaller design oriented tasks (button placement and calls to action). This worked well and there was less user fatigue.

        <div class="itemLeft content-74 blue pinch">
            Overall, I am happy with the way that this project came together. I struggled with the narrative of bringing it to life when doing surveys and reaching out to folks to get feedback and ask questions about their profession. I enjoyed the prototyping phases - it was good to iterate the way I did and not worry about how things visually looked. I felt like this allowed me to be fully focused on the user and not drive their opinion one way or the other.
            <br>
            <br>I learned in this project that it is important to talk to as many people as possible. You can hypothesize what your users will want, think and feel but you don’t know their true priorities unless you do the research. It was also important for me to be empathetic in this process as this issue is something that is close to me.
